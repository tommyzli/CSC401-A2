Perplexity values:
 - MLE:
    - English:  11.4924
    - French:   13.0460

 - delta = 1:
    - English:  64.9935
    - French:   97.5052

 - delta = 0.5:
    - English:  48.2781
    - French:   68.3921

 - delta = 0.25:
    - English:  37.2765
    - French:   49.8563

 - delta = 0.01:
    - English:  18.0660
    - French:   19.0890

 - delta = 0.001:
    - English:  15.3685
    - French:   14.6375


According to my observations, MLE resulted in the lowest perplexity values.
For add-delta smoothing, the perplexity values decrease as delta approaches 0.
Additionally, for delta values of 1, 0.5, and 0.25, there is a significant
difference in the perplexity values of English and French, with French usually
having higher perplexity values than the English corpus on the same delta value.
However, as delta approaches 0, the difference in English and French perplexity
values decrease.
